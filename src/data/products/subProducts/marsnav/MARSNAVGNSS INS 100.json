        "description": "MARSNAV-GNSS/INS 100 is an advanced navigation system that integrates GNSS and INS data, enhanced by an Adaptive Linear Kalman Filter for real-time 3D positioning, velocity, and orientation. Equipped with a high-performance multi-band, multi-constellation GNSS receiver, it delivers exceptional accuracy: 0.5° RMS for pitch and roll, 1° RMS (static) and 2° RMS (dynamic) for yaw, along with precise position and velocity metrics. Engineered for precision and reliability, this system is optimized for diverse applications across land, marine, and aerospace domains.",
